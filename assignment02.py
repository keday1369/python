#
#   1. Create a new branch in PyCharm with name assignment02
#   2. Write python code corresponding to the problems below.
#   3. Use PyCharm to add, commit, and push your changes into your git branch.
#   4. Go to github.com and create a 'Pull Request' for the 'assignment02' branch, and assign it to 'mtday'
#

# Example Problem: Create a variable called "z" with an integer value of:   10

z = 10

# Problem 1: Create a variable called "a" with an integer value of:   -5
a = -5

# Problem 2: Create a variable called "b" with a floating point value of:   3.5
b = 3.5

# Problem 2: Create a variable called "c" with a string value of:   Hello
c = "Hello"

# Problem 3: Create a variable called "d" with a string value of:   She said, "Hello"
d = 'She said, "Hello"'

# Problem 4: Create a variable called "e" with a string value of:   He replied, "I'm fine, thank you!"
e = 'He replied, "I\'m fine, thank you!"'

# Problem 5: Create a variable called "f" that is the variable "a" divided by "b" using floating point division.
f = a / b

# Problem 6: Create a variable called "g" that is the variable "a" divided by "b" using integer division.
g = a // b

# Problem 7: Create a variable called "h" that contains variables "c" and "d" concatenated together.
h = c + d

# Problem 8: Create a variable called "j" that is a list containing variables "a", "b", and "c".
j = [a, b, c]

# Problem 9: Create a variable called "k" set to the first value in the list "j", using square brackets.
k = j[0]

# Problem 10: Create a variable called "m" set to the last value in the list "j", using square brackets with a
# negative index.
m = j[-1]

# Problem 11: Create a variable called "n" set to the sum of the first and second elements from list "j".
n = j[0] + j[1]
