#
#   1. Create a new branch in PyCharm with name assignment03
#   2. Write python code corresponding to the problems below.
#   3. Use PyCharm to add, commit, and push your changes into your git branch.
#   4. Go to github.com and create a 'Pull Request' for the 'assignment03' branch, and assign it to 'mtday'
#   5. Read the next lesson:  http://www.python-course.eu/python3_list_manipulation.php
#

# Problem 1: Create a variable called "a" that is a list containing the numbers 0 through 5.


# Problem 2: Create a variable called "b" that is a tuple containing the numbers 0 through 5.


# Problem 3: Print out the list from variable "a".


# Problem 4: Print out the tuple from variable "b".


# Problem 5: Print out the first value from the list in variable "a" using square brackets.


# Problem 6: Print out the first value from the tuple in variable "b" using square brackets.


# Problem 7: Print out the first three values from the list in variable "a" using slicing
# (should print out "[0, 1, 2]").


# Problem 8: Print out the first three values from the tuple in variable "b" using slicing
# (should print out "[0, 1, 2]").


# Problem 9: Print out the second, third, and fourth values from the list in variable "a" using slicing
# (should print out "[1, 2, 3]").


# Problem 10: Print out the last three values from the list in variable "a" using slicing
# (should print out "[3, 4, 5]").


# Problem 11: Print out the length of the list in variable "a" using the 'len' function.


# Problem 12: Print out the length of the tuple in variable "b" using the 'len' function.


# Problem 13: Use the "+" operator to create a new list variable called "c" that is list "a" with 6 and 7
# concatenated to the end.


# Problem 14: Use the "+" operator to create a new tuple variable called "d" that is tuple "b" with 6 and 7
# concatenated to the end.


# Problem 15: Create a variable called "e" that is a list containing the list "a" and the tuple "b".


# Problem 16: Print out the first element of list "e" (should print out list "a").


# Problem 17: Print out the second element inside the second element of list "e" (should print out "1").


# Problem 18: Use the "in" keyword to print whether 3 is in the list "a" (should print "True").


# Problem 19: Use the "in" and "or" keywords to print whether 3 or 7 is in the list "a" (should print "True").
