# Problem 1: Create a variable called "s" that is an empty set.


# Problem 2: Create a variable called "list" that is a list containing the values 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3.


# Problem 3: Create a variable called "myset" that is a set populated with the distinct values from "list",
# and print the resulting set. The output should be:   {1, 2, 3}


# Problem 4: Add the value 1 to the set "s", and print the result. The output should be:   {1}


# Problem 5: Use square brackets to change the value of "B" to 4 in the letters dictionary,
# and print the result. The output should be:   {'A': 3, 'B': 4}


# Problem 6: Retrieve and print the value associated with the key "A" in the dictionary. The output should be:   3


# Problem 7: Print out the length of "myset". The output should be:   3


# Problem 8: Print out the boolean value indicating whether "myset" contains the value "2".
# The output should be:    True


# Problem 9: Remove 2 from "myset", and print the resulting set. The output should be:   {1, 3}


# Problem 10: Remove all values from "myset", and print the resulting set. The output should be:   set()
